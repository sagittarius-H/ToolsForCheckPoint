**What is it about? :** <br>
Main purpose of this utility is visialize data from cpview database. 
Visialization allows you review RAM/CPU/Policy installation/Interface traffic loads history quickly, easy and without
reference to CheckPoint appliance itself 
(standard way require use cpview utility via SSH connection or Monitoring blade via SmartConsole GUI client). 
Just extract cpview_services.dat from taken cpinfo file and visialisation will be ready after a few clicks! <br>

**Important notes:**
* Currently available only RAM history visialisation, CPU/Policy Installation in the progress.
* I'm tested it only with the latest and actual Gaia OS data without legacy, from R81 - R81.20, so there are can be bugs due version mismatch.
